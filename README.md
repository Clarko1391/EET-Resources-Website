This website is meant to be a one-stop-shop for all resources needed for Electrical Engineering Technology students. This repo is the first prototype of the site that will be used to gather feedback on the features and ideas that will be implemented in it.

I designed this website in Figma and have been working in my free time to build the code base from HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla JS. Due to the COVID-19 Pandemic forcing most classes to be conducted online, I am also gathering content from one of my instructors who is digitizing the bulk of his course materials and plan to integrate these materials directly into the source code of this website.

This website is currently hosted through Github Pages and can be seen live here: https://clarko1391.github.io/EET-Resources-Website/
